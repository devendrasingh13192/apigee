Describe how you'd implement a canary release strategy in Apigee. explain in very brief


### **Canary Releases in Apigee (Brief)**  

1. **Deploy New Version**  
   - Upload **v2 proxy** alongside **v1** (same base path).  

2. **Route % Traffic**  
   - Use **`RouteRule`** with conditions (e.g., `random() < 0.1` for 10%).  

3. **Monitor Metrics**  
   - Track **latency/errors** in Apigee Analytics.  

4. **Gradual Ramp-Up**  
   - Increase traffic (10% → 50% → 100%) if stable.  

5. **Rollback**  
   - Revert to **v1** if failures spike.  

**Key Tools**:  
- **Conditional Flows** + **Analytics**.  
- **Load Balancer** (for weighted routing).  

**Result**: **Low-risk rollouts!** 🚀
