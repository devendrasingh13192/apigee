How would you use ServiceCallout vs. TargetEndpoint and when to choose each? explain in very brief

### **ServiceCallout vs. TargetEndpoint in Apigee (Brief)**  

#### **`ServiceCallout`**  
- **What**: Makes **internal/sub-requests** during proxy flow (e.g., call another API).  
- **When**:  
  - Fetch **additional data** mid-flow (e.g., auth validation).  
  - **Async** calls (non-blocking).  
  - **Aggregate responses** from multiple services.  

#### **`TargetEndpoint`**  
- **What**: Defines the **final backend** for the API request.  
- **When**:  
  - **Primary backend call** (e.g., your database/service).  
  - Needs **load balancing/timeout** control.  

#### **Key Difference**:  
- **`ServiceCallout`**: Side-calls **during** processing.  
- **`TargetEndpoint`**: **Final destination** of the request.  

**Choose `ServiceCallout`** for internal lookups; **`TargetEndpoint`** for main backend. 🚀
