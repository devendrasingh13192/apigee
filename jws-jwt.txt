This topic provides general information about JWT (JSON Web Token) and JWS (JSON Web Signature) and the Apigee 
JWS/JWT policies that may be of interest to Apigee proxy developers.

Introduction

Both JWS and JWT are commonly used to share claims or assertions between connected applications. 
The JWS/JWT policies enables Edge API proxies to:

Generate a signed JWT or JWS.
Verify a signed JWT or JWS and claims within the JWS/JWT.
Decode a signed JWT or JWS without validating the signature.

In the latter two cases, the policy also sets variables that allow additional policies, or the backend services themselves, 
to inspect the validated claims and to make decisions based on those claims.

When using the Verify JWS/JWT policy, an invalid JWS/JWT will be rejected and will result in an error condition. Similarly, 
when using the Decode JWS/JWT policy, a malformed JWS/JWT will result in an error condition.


Use cases

You can use the JWS/JWT policies to:

Generate a new JWS/JWT on either the proxy or target endpoint sides of an Edge proxy. For example, you might create a proxy 
request flow that generates a JWS/JWT and returns it to a client. Or, you might design a proxy so that it generates a JWS/JWT 
on the target request flow, and attaches it to the request sent to the target. Those claims would then be available to enable 
backend services to apply further security processing.

Verify and extract claims from a JWS/JWT obtained from inbound client requests, from target service responses, from Service Callout
policy responses, or from other sources. Edge will verify the signature on a JWS/JWT, whether the JWS/JWT was generated by a 
third-party, or by Edge itself, using either RSA or HMAC algorithms.

Decode a JWS/JWT. Decoding is most useful when used in concert with the Verify JWS/JWT policy, when the value of a claim (JWT) or 
header (JWS/JWT) from within the JWS/JWT must be known before verifying the JWS/JWT.
