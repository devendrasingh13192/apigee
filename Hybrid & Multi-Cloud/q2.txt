How would you implement cross-cloud API management with Apigee? explain in very brief

### **Cross-Cloud API Management with Apigee (Brief)**  

1. **Centralized Apigee Instance**  
   - Deploy **Apigee X** in one cloud (e.g., GCP) as control plane.  

2. **Multi-Cloud Gateways**  
   - Use **Apigee Hybrid** or **Microgateways** on other clouds (AWS/Azure).  

3. **Unified Policies**  
   - Enforce **OAuth, quotas, logging** consistently across clouds.  

4. **Global Load Balancing**  
   - Route traffic via **Cloud CDN** or **Multi-CDN** for low latency.  

5. **Single Analytics**  
   - Aggregate logs in **BigQuery** or **Splunk** for cross-cloud visibility.  

**Result**: **One control plane, multi-cloud APIs!** 🌐
