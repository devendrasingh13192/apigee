✅ Security token flow
✅ Caching strategies
✅ CI/CD pipeline for Apigee
✅ High-availability setup
```

#### **Day 5-7: Scenario-Based Content**
```markdown
Enhance your InterviewTopics with:

✅ Team collaboration examples
✅ Project migration experience
```

#### **Day 11-14: Technical Deep Dives**
```markdown
Prepare to explain:
✅ Rate Limiting vs Quota vs Spike Arrest (in detail)
✅ Apigee Edge vs Hybrid vs X differences
✅ Caching strategies and eviction policies
✅ Monitoring and analytics implementation
```

### **Week 3-4: Mock Interviews & Refinement**

## 🛠 **Let's Start with Immediate Actions:**

### **1. Advanced Policy Examples I'll Help You Create:**
```xml
<!-- Example: OAuth 2.0 Implementation -->
We'll create:
- /policies/oauth-token-generation.xml
- /policies/oauth-token-validation.xml  
- /policies/jwt-generation.xml
- /policies/advanced-caching.xml
```

### **2. Interview Topic Enhancement:**
Let's pick **3 key topics** to deepen first:
- **Security** (OAuth, JWT, API Keys)
- **Traffic Management** (Rate limiting strategies)
- **Troubleshooting** (Common issues and solutions)

## 🎯 **Today's Starting Point:**

**Which area would you like to tackle first?**

1. **Create advanced security policy examples?**
2. **Develop interview stories from your 7 years of experience?**
3. **Build architecture diagrams for complex scenarios?**
4. **Practice explaining specific Apigee concepts?**

Choose your starting point, and I'll provide detailed guidance and examples! The goal is to make your repository so comprehensive that it becomes your personal interview playbook. 💪
