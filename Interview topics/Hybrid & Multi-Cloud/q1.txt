Explain the key considerations when designing a hybrid Apigee implementation in very brief

### **Hybrid Apigee Implementation (Brief)**  

1. **Network Connectivity**  
   - Secure **VPN/Private Peering** between cloud and on-prem.  

2. **Runtime Plane**  
   - Deploy **Apigee Hybrid** on **Kubernetes** (GKE/Anthos) near backends.  

3. **Data Sovereignty**  
   - Keep sensitive data on-prem; public APIs in cloud.  

4. **CI/CD Sync**  
   - Unified pipeline for cloud + hybrid components.  

5. **Monitoring**  
   - Centralized logs/metrics (Stackdriver, Splunk).  

**Result**: **Cloud agility + on-prem control!** 🌐
