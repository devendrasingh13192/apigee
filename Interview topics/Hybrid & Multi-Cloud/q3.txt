Describe your experience with Apigee hybrid and runtime plane architecture in very brief

### **Apigee Hybrid & Runtime Plane (Brief)**  

1. **Hybrid Setup**  
   - Deployed **runtime plane** on **GKE/Anthos** (on-prem/cloud).  
   - Managed **synchronization** between Apigee control plane (cloud) and runtime (K8s).  

2. **Key Components**  
   - **Cassandra/Mart**: For distributed caching.  
   - **Envoy**: Edge proxy for traffic routing.  

3. **Use Cases**  
   - **Low-latency APIs** (runtime near backends).  
   - **Data residency compliance** (keep processing on-prem).  

4. **Challenges Solved**  
   - **Auto-scaling** runtime pods.  
   - **Secure** cloud-to-on-prem connectivity.  

**Result**: **Cloud flexibility + on-prem control!** 🏗️
