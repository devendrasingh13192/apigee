2. "Describe a conflict you resolved within your team"

Situation:
During a major Apigee implementation, our team split into two camps about security implementation - one favoring API keys for simplicity, the other insisting on OAuth 2.0 for enterprise standards.

Task:
Bridge the technical disagreement without compromising security or development velocity.

Action:

Facilitated Technical Deep Dive: Organized a session where both sides presented their cases with data

Proposed Hybrid Solution: Implemented API keys for internal microservices and OAuth 2.0 for external APIs

Created Governance Framework: Established clear criteria for when to use each approach

Built Shared Components: Developed reusable security policies that supported both methods

Technical Implementation:

<!-- Hybrid security approach in Apigee -->
<Flow name="Internal-API">
  <Condition>request.header.x-internal-context != null</Condition>
  <Request>
    <Step><Name>Verify-API-Key</Name></Step>
  </Request>
</Flow>

<Flow name="External-API">
  <Condition>request.header.x-internal-context == null</Condition>
  <Request>
    <Step><Name>Validate-OAuth-Token</Name></Step>
  </Request>
</Flow>

Result:

Team reached consensus and implemented hybrid approach

Reduced initial development time by 40% while maintaining security

Improved team collaboration on future technical decisions
