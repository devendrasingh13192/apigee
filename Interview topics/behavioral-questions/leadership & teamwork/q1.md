1. "Tell me about a time you had to convince a team to adopt new technology"

Situation:
At my previous role, our team was using traditional XML-based SOAP APIs while the industry was rapidly moving toward RESTful JSON APIs. We were facing increasing maintenance costs and developer frustration with the complex SOAP implementations.

Task:
I needed to convince both the technical team and management to migrate our core Apigee infrastructure from SOAP to REST, which required significant upfront investment but promised long-term benefits.

Action:

Created a Business Case: I prepared a detailed comparison showing 40% reduction in payload size and 30% faster processing with JSON

Built a Prototype: Developed a RESTful version of our most complex customer API in Apigee, demonstrating:

<!-- Showed simplified policies -->
<AssignMessage name="Transform-SOAP-to-REST">
  <Set>
    <Payload contentType="application/json">
      {
        "customer": {
          "id": "{soapBody.customer.id}",
          "name": "{soapBody.customer.name}"
        }
      }
    </Payload>
  </Set>
</AssignMessage>

Conducted Workshops: Ran hands-on sessions showing how REST reduced our policy complexity

Phased Rollout Plan: Proposed migrating non-critical APIs first to build confidence

Result:

Team adopted REST migration over 6 months

35% reduction in API development time

Improved mobile app performance by 25%
