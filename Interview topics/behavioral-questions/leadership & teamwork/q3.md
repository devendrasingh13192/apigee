3. "How do you handle technical disagreements?"
My Approach:
I follow a structured method for technical disagreements:

1. Data-Driven Discussion: Start with metrics and evidence

    "Let's look at the performance data for both approaches"

    "What are the measurable impacts of each option?"

2. Prototype and Test: When possible, build quick proofs-of-concept

    Created A/B testing for different Apigee caching strategies

    Measured actual performance rather than theoretical benefits

3. Consider Trade-offs Transparently:

    Maintain a decision log with pros/cons

    Acknowledge valid points from all sides

4. Escalate When Needed: Involve architects or SMEs for impartial perspective

Example: When debating JavaScript vs Java callouts in Apigee, we:

    Benchmarked both for our specific use case

    Documented maintenance overhead vs performance gains

    Chose JavaScript for simple transformations, Java for complex logic

    Created clear guidelines for future decisions
