### **1. "Describe a project where you had to manage competing priorities"**

**Situation:**
While leading Apigee implementation for a banking client, we had three competing priorities:
1. Regulatory compliance deadline (fixed date)
2. New customer-facing features (business priority)
3. Technical debt reduction (engineering priority)

**Task:**
Balance these competing demands without compromising quality or missing deadlines.

**Strategy:**
- **Created Transparency:** Mapped all requirements on a shared timeline
- **Stakeholder Alignment:** Facilitated meetings where business and compliance teams understood technical constraints
- **Incremental Delivery:** Broke compliance requirements into smaller, testable chunks

**Execution:**
- **Week 1-4:** Focused on compliance-critical security policies

  ```
- **Week 5-8:** Parallel streams - compliance completion + high-impact features
- **Week 9-12:** Technical debt reduction while maintaining velocity

**Result:**
- Met all compliance deadlines with 2 weeks to spare
- Delivered 80% of requested features
- Reduced critical technical debt by 60%
- Stakeholders praised the transparent prioritization process
