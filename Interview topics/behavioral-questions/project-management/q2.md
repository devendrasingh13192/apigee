### **2. "How do you handle scope creep?"**

**My Approach to Scope Management:**

1. **Prevention through Clarity:**
   - "I start with detailed API specifications and acceptance criteria"
   - "Use OpenAPI specifications to define clear boundaries"

2. **Change Control Process:**
   - "All scope changes require impact analysis"
   - "Maintain a 'parking lot' for future enhancements"

3. **Communicate Trade-offs:**
   - "When new requests come in, I clearly explain what might be delayed"
   - "Use data to show impact on timeline and quality"

**Real Example:**
During a payment API project, marketing requested adding loyalty points calculation - outside original scope.

**My Response:**
- "I can add this feature, but it will delay the launch by 2 weeks due to:"
  - Additional Apigee policies for points calculation
  - New backend service integration
  - Extended testing requirements
- "Alternative: Launch without points, then add in Phase 2"
- **Outcome:** Business chose Phase 2 approach, launched on time
