2. "Tell me about a time you failed and what you learned"

Situation:
Early in my Apigee career, I led a project to implement a complex OAuth 2.0 authorization server. I was overconfident and skipped thorough load testing.

The Failure:
During production launch, the token generation endpoint failed under moderate load, causing a 2-hour service outage.

What Went Wrong:

    Underestimated the cryptographic overhead of JWT generation

    Used synchronous database calls for token storage

    No circuit breaker for database dependencies

Immediate Recovery:

    Rolled back to previous authentication system

    Implemented Redis caching for token validation

    Added rate limiting to prevent system overload

Lessons Learned:

    Always Load Test: Now I mandate performance testing for all security components

    Design for Failure: Implement circuit breakers and graceful degradation

    Monitor Cryptography: JWT operations are CPU-intensive at scale

Improved Implementation:

    // Added caching for JWT validation
var cachedToken = context.getVariable('cache.jwt.' + tokenSignature);
if (cachedToken === 'valid') {
    context.setVariable('jwt.validation.cached', 'true');
    return; // Skip crypto verification
}

Long-term Impact:

    Became the team's go-to person for performance and resilience

    Established mandatory load testing criteria for all API deployments

    This experience made me a more cautious and thorough engineer
