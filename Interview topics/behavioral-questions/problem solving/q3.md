3. "How do you approach debugging complex issues?"


**My Systematic Debugging Framework:**

1. **Reproduce and Isolate:**
   - "First, I try to recreate the issue in a controlled environment"
   - "Use Apigee debug sessions to capture request/response flows"

2. **Divide and Conquer:**
   - "I break the API flow into segments - security, routing, transformation, backend"
   - "Test each policy independently to identify the failing component"

3. **Leverage Monitoring:**
   - "Analyze Apigee analytics for patterns and anomalies"
   - "Check custom metrics and business data"

4. **Hypothesis-Driven Testing:**
   - "Formulate theories based on evidence"
   - "Create targeted tests to validate each hypothesis"

**Real Example:**
When debugging random 500 errors:
- **Hypothesis 1:** Backend instability - ruled out by backend metrics
- **Hypothesis 2:** Policy errors - used debug sessions to identify JavaScript policy throwing null reference
- **Root Cause:** Race condition when response content was empty
- **Fix:** Added null checks in JavaScript policies

```javascript
// BEFORE: Causing random errors
var data = JSON.parse(context.getVariable('response.content'));
var user = data.user.name;

// AFTER: Defensive programming
var content = context.getVariable('response.content');
var data = content ? JSON.parse(content) : {};
var user = data.user ? data.user.name : 'Unknown';
