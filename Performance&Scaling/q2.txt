What strategies would you use to reduce latency in Apigee API calls? explain in very brief

### **Reducing Latency in Apigee (Brief)**  

1. **Edge Caching**  
   - Use **`ResponseCache`** to store frequent responses.  
   - Set optimal **`Cache-Control`** headers (e.g., `max-age=300`).  

2. **Minimize Policy Execution**  
   - Avoid unnecessary policies (e.g., **conditional checks**).  
   - Use **`FaultRules`** to skip post-error processing.  

3. **Optimize Backend Calls**  
   - **Compress payloads** (GZIP).  
   - **Batch requests** (merge multiple calls into one).  

4. **Geographic Distribution**  
   - Deploy **Apigee instances closer to users** (e.g., multi-region in Apigee X).  

5. **Async Processing**  
   - Use **`ServiceCallout` with `Async=true`** for non-critical tasks.  

6. **Pre-fetch & Warm-Up**  
   - Warm caches during off-peak hours.  

**Result**: **Faster APIs, happier users!** ⚡
