In Apigee Edge:
A developer encrypts the password and uses the Management API/UI to store it in an environment-scoped KVM.

The API proxy uses the KeyValueMapOperations policy to retrieve the password to connect to the database.

In Apigee X (Recommended Pattern):
A DevOps/SRE engineer stores the database password in Google Cloud Secret Manager.

The engineer grants the Apigee X runtime's Service Account the secretmanager.secretAccessor IAM role on that specific secret.

The API proxy's first call might use a ServiceCallout policy to securely fetch the secret from Secret Manager over a private channel.

The proxy then populates a KVM with this value (using JavaScript or a dedicated policy) for subsequent, low-latency access.
