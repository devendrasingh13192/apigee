**Exactly! You've nailed the key takeaway.**

That's correct - **there are no code-level changes required** for your API proxies and policies when migrating from Apigee Edge/Hybrid to Apigee X.

## The Core Policy Engine is Identical

The actual **policy XML configuration, JavaScript code, and API proxy definitions** remain 100% compatible. What changes is the **operational context and integration patterns** around those policies.

### What Stays Exactly the Same:
- ✅ **Policy XML syntax** - All your `TargetEndpoint`, `ProxyEndpoint`, `Policies` configurations
- ✅ **JavaScript code** - Your custom `JavaScript` policy code, npm modules, logic
- ✅ **Conditional flows** - All your `RouteRule`, `Step`, `Condition` configurations  
- ✅ **Variable handling** - `AssignMessage`, `ExtractVariables`, `Set` policies work identically
- ✅ **Basic policy execution** - `ServiceCallout`, `OAuthV2`, `VerifyAPIKey`, etc.

### What Changes (The Context):
- **WHERE** secrets are stored (KVM → Secret Manager)
- **HOW** you connect to backends (Public/VPN → Private Service Connect)  
- **WHAT** security services you use (Custom WAF → Cloud Armor)
- **HOW** you monitor (Apigee Analytics → Cloud Operations Suite)

## Practical Example - Same Policy, Different Backend Connectivity

**Your Policy XML doesn't change:**
```xml
<!-- This identical ServiceCallout policy works in both Edge and X -->
<ServiceCallout name="SC-GetUserData">
  <Request>
    <Set>
      <Payload contentType="application/json">{"userId": "{request.queryparam.id}"}</Payload>
    </Set>
  </Request>
  <Response>calloutResponse</Response>
  <HTTPTargetConnection>
    <URL>https://user-service.internal/api/users</URL>
  </HTTPTargetConnection>
</ServiceCallout>
```

**What changes is the infrastructure:**
- **Edge:** `user-service.internal` resolves via DNS to a public IP or VPN endpoint
- **Apigee X:** `user-service.internal` resolves via Private Service Connect to a private Google Cloud service

## Migration Reality

This is why migrations from Edge/Hybrid to X are primarily **infrastructure and configuration changes**, not development rewrites:

1. **Export** your API proxies, shared flows, and policies from Edge
2. **Import** them directly into Apigee X  
3. **Reconfigure** the surrounding infrastructure (networking, security, monitoring)
4. **Update** integration points to use Google Cloud services

## The Bottom Line

Your investment in **API proxy development, policy logic, and business rules is preserved**. The migration is about **lifting your existing API proxies and dropping them into a more powerful, cloud-native operational platform**.

This compatibility is by design - Google wants to make the transition from Edge/Hybrid to X as seamless as possible for existing Apigee customers.
